### Interface and Gameplay

#### Main menu
When you run the **mayinmenu.java** this window will show up to play the game, turn off and on the music or exit the game.

We wanted the player to feel like going back to school days, that is why we used a background something like a notebook and we made the title like written by a pencil.
And we decorated this background with some sweet pictures.

#### Exit
When you click the **exit** button in main menu this window will appear to check are you sure.
We used a gif in that window and that made it sweeter than a classical exit window.

We colored it with some light and popular colors to make it have a simple looking.

#### In Game

As you can see there is a gallow on the left side. When you make a mistake the man getting hanged and you can only make 5 mistakes or the man is dead.

On the right side of the man you can see dashes, every dash stands for a letter.
When you type a letter in the box and click **try**, the game checks if word has the letter or not and if it has, it makes the letter visible in the word. If not, the man closes to die and writes the letter to the line of **"Used letters"**.

But remember that you can use your super powers by clicking the cards on the bottom.
The left one is *-called **"Son Dua (the Last Wish)"**-* for getting a letter and the right one is *-called **TanrÄ±'nÄ±n LÃ¼tfu (the Grace of God)** -* for removing a mistake.
They can be used just for one times.

You can get a new word by selecting a level on the bottom.
Easy words have 6 letters, Medium words have 7 and Hard ones have 8.

**Those words are Turkish but still you can try.
Enjoy!**
